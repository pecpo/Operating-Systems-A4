Bridge Crossing Simulation
Overview

This C code simulates the movement of cars across a bridge, considering constraints such as a limited number of cars allowed on the bridge simultaneously and different numbers of cars on the left and right sides of the bridge.
Features

    Semaphore Usage: The code utilizes semaphores to control access to the bridge, ensuring that the maximum number of cars allowed on the bridge is not exceeded.
    Thread Modeling: Cars on the left and right sides are represented as separate threads.
    Bridge Crossing Logic: Cars are permitted to cross the bridge based on certain conditions and synchronization using semaphores.

Code Components

    left() and right() Functions: These functions model the behavior of cars on the left and right sides of the bridge, respectively. They handle the logic for allowing cars to cross when conditions permit.
    passing() Function: Represents the bridge-crossing activity by the cars. This function is invoked when a car is allowed to cross the bridge.

Running the Code

    The code prompts the user to input the number of cars on the left and right sides.
    Each car is represented as a separate thread using pthread_create().
    The program waits for all threads to finish using pthread_join() before cleanup.

Compilation

To compile and run the code, just do make in your terminal

Usage

    Run the compiled executable.
    Follow the on-screen prompts to input the number of cars on each side.
    Observe the bridge-crossing simulation.
